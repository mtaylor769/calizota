        </button>
    </div>
    <!-- .cart-section end -->

    <div class="cart-form">
        <div class="cart-item-container cart-section">
        </div>
        <!-- .cart-bottom begin -->
        <div class="cart-bottom">
            <div class="cart-info clearfix cart-section">
                <div class="type--caps cart-info__total cart-info__small">Total</div>
                <div class="cart-info__pricing">
                    <span class="cart-info__small cart-info__total">CAD</span>
                    <span class="pricing pricing--no-padding"></span>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="cart-actions-container cart-section type--center">
                <div class="cart-discount-notice cart-info__small">Shipping and discount codes are added at checkout.</div>

            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- .cart-bottom end -->
    </div>
    <!-- .cart-form end -->

    </div>
    <!-- .cart end -->

    <script id="CartItemTemplate" type="text/template">

            <div id="cart-item-id" class="hidden"></div>
            <div class="cart-item__img"></div>
            <div class="cart-item__content">
                <div class="cart-item__content-row">
                    <div class="cart-item__variant-title"></div>
                    <span class="cart-item__title"></span>
                </div>
                <div class="cart-item__content-row">
                    <div class="cart-item__quantity-container">
                        <button class="btn--seamless quantity-decrement" type="button"><span>-</span><span class="visuallyhidden"><!-- Decrement --></span></button>
                        <input class="cart-item__quantity" type="number" min="0" aria-label="Quantity">
                        <button class="btn--seamless quantity-increment" type="button"><span>+</span><span class="visuallyhidden"><!-- Increment --></span></button>
                    </div>
                    <span class="cart-item__price"></span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </script>

    <!-- END - Shopify Cart HTML -->
    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
