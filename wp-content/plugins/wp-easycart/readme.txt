== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get documentation or demos? =
We offer a full service website with online documentation, video tutorials, community support forums as well as demonstration sites running our various templates at [WP EasyCart](http://www.wpeasycart.com/ "WP EasyCart website") .

= Can I use your software to display, but not sell products? =
Absolutely! If you do not need to sell anything, but would like to leverage our software to display products, please feel free to do just that!  You can just put the store into catalog mode and it removes the ability to add to cart the products.

= What is the FREE, Lite, and Standard Versions? =
FREE version comes from wordpress and offers limited features for you to test.  Manual payments is accepted, but coupons, live shipping rates, promotions are not included.  Lite version jumps up to 3rd party processing (paypal standard).  The Full version jumps up to coupons, promotions, live shipping, and full payment gateways.

= How does a license work with your software? =
The free plugin is the full WordPress ecommerce shopping cart software version; however, the administrative software that is downloaded from our website is licensed software. The administrative software will allow a certain number of products and features to be used in the cart software. You may continue to run the WordPress plugin, but must purchase a license to use our administrative software.
Each license is good for one website URL or WordPress installation. You may transfer a license from a development environment to a production environment at any time; it is your license once you purchase one.
Licensing gives you features such as coupons, promotions, live shipping rate calculators and more. Plus you will receive support from our staff individually rather than through our community open support systems. For more information on licensing, you can view our website.

= Do I have to pay monthly? =
Not to us. Our standard ecommerce shopping cart plugin is a one-time purchase. Your payment gateway provider such as PayPal, Authorize.net, FirstData or others may or may not have monthly fees, but nothing through EasyCart.
If you purchase a monthly hosted plan, then we do have a monthly charge program for those who prefer this method.

= Will it work in my Theme? =
Yes!  EasyCart works on 3 wordpress pages, simply create a store, cart, and account page and attach our shortcode on each one.  Our installer walks you through the steps quickly and if you have any theme issues, your theme developer or our staff can assist.

= What payment gateways do you have? =
We offer over 30 different gateways.  Popular ones include PayPal Standard, PayPal Pro, PayPal Payflow, authorize.net, stripe.com, firstdata, eway, payment express, sagepay, and many others.  Check our documentation for a full up to date listing.

= How do I add categories, manufacturers, or price range filters to my WordPress site? =
Simply go to the widgets page, and drag over the widget corresponding to the filter you wish to display to any widget area.
